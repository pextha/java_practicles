Question

Develop a code for the following scenario. 
“An encapsulated class contains three variables to store Name, Age and Salary of the employee. Evelop getters and setters to set and get values . Develop a test class to test your code.”
Now modify the same code by  trying to replace the setters using  a constructor. 

Code for the last example has been discussed during the class. We need the following Output. (Use Netbeans code generation option where necessary)
Employee Name: xxxxx (Use setter to set and getter to retrieve)
Basic Salary: xxxx (Use setter to set and getter to retrieve)
Bonus: xxxx (You may use the constructor to pass this value)
Bonus Amount: xxxxx (Develop a separate method to calculate Bonus amount. Bonus amount is the total of Bonus and Basic Salary)
E.g. 
Employee Name: Bogdan
Basic Salary: 50000 
Bonus: 10000 
Bonus Amount: 60000
